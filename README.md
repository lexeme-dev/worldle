# Worldle


TODOs:
1. Require uuid to be provided for game mutation since IDs are easily guessable
2. Add settings to allow configuring which kinds of countries are selected.
3. Show user stats
4. Add some box from which the user can copy their UUID and a box where they can enter an existing UUID so they can carry over progress and stats
